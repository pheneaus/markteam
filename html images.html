	<p> A mobile phone (also known as a hand phone, cell phone, or cellular telephone) is a small portable radio telephone.
<br><br>
The <em>mobile phone</em> can be used to communicate over long distances without wires. It works by communicating with a nearby base station (also called a "cell site") which connects it to the main phone network. When moving, if the mobile phone gets too far away from the cell it is connected to, that cell sends a message to another cell to tell the new cell to take over the call. This is called a <strong>"hand off,"</strong> and the call continues with the new cell the phone is connected to. The hand-off is done so well and carefully that the user will usually never even know that the call was transferred to another cell.
<br>
<br>
As mobile phones became more popular, they began to <strong>cost less money, and more people could afford them.</strong> Monthly plans became available for rates as low as<em> US$30 or US$40 a month</em>. Cell phones have become so cheap to own that they have mostly replaced pay phones and phone booths except for urban areas with many people.
<br>
<br>
In the 21st century, a new type of mobile phone, called <strong>smartphones</strong>, have become popular. Now, more people are using smartphones than the old kind of mobile phone, which are called <strong>feature phones.</strong> </p>
