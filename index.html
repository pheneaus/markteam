        <p>Jaipur is a fascinating Indian city that boasts the finest examples of Rajasthan architecture and history but is blighted by the modern problems that afflict present day India. Located in <strong>Jaipur are magnificent forts, sumptuous palaces and inspiring religious temples</strong> but also chocking pollution and desperate poverty. Jaipur is a city of extremes, and visitors leave either loving it or detesting it. Any tour of northern India must include Jaipur, just be prepared for both emotional highs and lows. This guide will provide an introduction to Jaipur and links to further in-depth information.</p>
        
        
        <h2 class="h2">A suggested 3 day Itinerary for Jaipur</h2>

        <p>All of the main <strong>tourist attractions </strong>of Jaipur can be seen within two days and a further day allows for the exploration of the lesser sights. A typical 3 day itinerary would be;</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Day 1 -</strong> City Palace, Jantar Mantar and central Jaipur.</li>
            <li><strong>Day 2 -</strong> Amber fort and the Water Palace.</li>
            <li><strong>Day 3 -</strong> Jaigarh Fort and the Galta (monkey) temple.</li>
        </ul>
        
        If the visit is during the hot spring months an additional day may be required but no visit will be longer than four days. Jaipur is a destination that should be part of a tour, do not plan to spend an entire holiday based in Jaipur. For a guide to visiting Jaipur in

        <h2 class="h2">When to Visit Jaipur?</h2>

         <img class="img" src ="http://www.jaipur-travel-guide.com/images/weather/jaipur-weather.png" alt="Jaiur average weather" width="500" height="200">
        
        <p>The <strong>best season</strong> to visit Jaipur is <strong>during the winter months of November through to February</strong>. During this season the temperatures will at their lowest (but it is still hot). From April until the monsoon (July) temperatures can reach an unbearable 40C and combined with the pollution and dust makes sightseeing almost impossible. Jaipur experiences less heavy downpours during the monsoon season (July to September) than the rest of India but is not a great time to visit.</p>
        
       
        
        <h2 class="h2">What is the best tourist attraction of Jaipur?</h2>

          <img class="img" src ="http://www.jaipur-travel-guide.com/images/600px/Amer-Fort-jaipur.jpg" alt ="Jaipur Fort" width="500" height="200">

        
        <p> The stand out monument of Jaipur is the <strong>Amer Fort</strong>, this lavish <strong>16th century</strong> palace stands atop of a cliff and has commanding view over the region. The interior of the palace demonstrates the wealth and power of the mogul leaders; with jewel inlaid rooms to reflect the nights’ sky, cleverly designed air cooling systems and a harem with secrete passages.</p>
        
      
        <h2 class="h2">Why is Jaipur the Pink city?</h2>

        <img  class="img" src ="http://www.jaipur-travel-guide.com/images/600px/pink-jaipur.jpg" alt="Every street is painted pink in the historic centre" width="500" height="200">
        
        <p>Jaipur is known as the pink city as the <strong>historic centre of Jaipur</strong> is painted a terracotta <strong>pink colour </strong>and there is even a local law that instructs all buildings within Jaipur be painted the distinctive pink. The reason is that this pink is a royal colour and the entire city was painted, under the direction of the Maharajah for the visit of Prince Albert in 1876. </p>
        
        
        
        <h2 class="h2">Jaipur as part of a tour</h2>
        
        <p>Jaipur is <strong>situated</strong> between Delhi and the popular <strong>western Rajasthan area</strong>, therefore the city is a convenient destination to add to any tour of the region. For visitors following the shorter “Golden Triangle Tour route” Jaipur has a unique atmosphere and heritage when compared to Delhi and Agra</p>.
